# VLSI-AUTO

VLSI tools for Standard time analysis and floorplanning.

STA: a forward traverse function to find the delay, a backward traverse function to find the slack, and another function finding critical path based on the slacks of each gate.

Floorplanning: optimize the circuit plan (minimize the circuit size and/or wirelength) by doing simulated annealing. It is a complex design, see the report in the floorplanning folder.
